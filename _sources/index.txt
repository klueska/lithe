Welcome to Lithe's API Reference
==================================
For the software industry to take advantage of multicore processors, we must
allow programmers to arbitrarily compose parallel libraries without sacrificing
performance.  We believe that high-level task or thread abstractions built
around a common global scheduler cannot provide this composition effectively.
Instead, the operating system should expose unvirtualized processing resources
that can be shared cooperatively between parallel libraries within an
application. 

Lithe is a system that standardizes and facilitates the exchange
of these unvirtualized processing resources between libraries.
