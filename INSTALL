Lithe 1.0 - INSTALL
For questions or comments, please contact: Kevin Klues <klueska@cs.berkeley.edu>

To install this library, simply follow the standard GNU installation procedure.
If you have 'parlib' installed in a non-standard location, be sure and set the
--with-parlib configure option appropriately.  Otherwise, you can just ignore
it.

If building out of the git source repo, you will need to rerun autoconf and
automake.  You can do these two steps together, by just running autoreconf.
You therefore need to have the autotools installed on your system.
The installation procedure would be:

autoreconf --install
mkdir build
cd build
../configure --prefix=<install_dir>  --with-parlib=<parlib_install_dir>
make
make install

To clean up all generated files and get back to only files tracked by the git
repo, you can simply run:

git clean -x -d -f

If building out of the tarball distribution, you can skip the autoreconf step
entirely, as the files it generates are already provided to you (you can still
do it if you like though).

mkdir build
cd build
../configure --prefix=<install_dir>  --with-parlib=<parlib_install_dir>
make
make install

Don't forget to use 'sudo' if you are installing into a directory which
requires root priveleges.

Also, if you install to a non-standard <install_dir>, it's probably a good idea
to add these paths to a few environment variables.  Doing this will allow you
to compile and run programs that depend on this library much easier. I set
these variables in my .bashrc file in my home directory, but feel free to set
them however you like.

C_INCLUDE_PATH = <install_dir>/include
CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH = <install_dir>/include
LD_LIBRARY_PATH = <install_dir>/lib
LD_RUN_PATH = <install_dir>/lib

Alternatively, you can set up a gcc spec file so that these tools will be
available to all users on the system.  See the following link for details:
